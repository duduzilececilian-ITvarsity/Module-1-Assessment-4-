        <p>Furious 7 (titled onscreen as Furious Seven), also known as Fast & Furious 7, is a 2015 American action film directed by James Wan and written by Chris Morgan. It is the sequel to Fast & Furious 6 (2013) and the seventh installment in the Fast & Furious franchise. The film stars Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Dwayne Johnson, Michelle Rodriguez, Tyrese Gibson, Chris "Ludacris" Bridges, Jordana Brewster, Djimon Hounsou, Kurt Russell, and Jason Statham. In the film, Dominic Toretto, Brian O'Conner, and the rest of their team, who have returned to the United States to live normal lives after securing amnesty for their past crimes, until Deckard Shaw, a rogue special forces assassin seeking to avenge his comatose younger brother Owen Shaw, puts the team in danger once again. The film marks the final film appearance of Paul Walker, who died in 2013, and the film is dedicated to him, thus making it the character Brian O'Conner's final appearance.</p>
