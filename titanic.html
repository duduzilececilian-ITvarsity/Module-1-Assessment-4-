        <p>RMS Titanic was a British passenger liner operated by the White Star Line that sank in the North Atlantic Ocean on 15 April 1912, after striking an iceberg during her maiden voyage from Southampton to New York City. Of the estimated 2,224 passengers and crew aboard, more than 1,500 died, making the sinking at the time one of the deadliest of a single ship[a] and the deadliest peacetime sinking of a superliner or cruise ship to date.[4] With much public attention in the aftermath, the disaster has since been the material of many artistic works and a founding material of the disaster film genre.</p>
